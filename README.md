## 🧠 Why I Built This

Like most of us, I used to jump between apps just to check the weather, browse the news, or search for quick info.  
So I thought – *"What if I build my own AI assistant?"* That’s how Billu was born – as part of my final year project, and now, a personal assistant I actually use.

This isn’t just a chatbot.  
🧠 It understands your query.  
🧰 Picks the best tool.  
📬 And responds like a helpful friend (with emojis too 😄).
